  I will specifically discuss why and how we coupled Tangible interaction, immersive virtual environment and geospatial analytics to make ecological design process more effective and to bridge the gaps between experiential and ecological analysis of landscape.
  In the first part of this talk, I will briefly discuss the need and motivation behind this development within the context of ecological design and research.
  Then I will briefly introduce and provide a background about Tangible Landscape, a tangible interface for GIS, which we have been developing and applying for couple years now, and then I will present our recent coupling of TL with Immersive virtual environments,
  and explain how this coupling enhances our current approaches to ecological design and research.

  During the last few decades, and specially the last decade, there has been an increasing attention on the impact of landscape exposure on human physiological and psychological well-being.
  Frameworks such as Cultural ecosystem services, Gobster’s aesthetic-ecological paradigm,
  Nassaurs’ cultural ecological have tried to illuminate the conceptual common-grounds between the ecological functioning and human perception and experience of landscape.

<aside class="notes">

  However, when put in the context of landscape design and research, the ecological and experiential factors reveal notable disparities in many aspects.
  In terms of representation, we all tend to show the landscape feel and experience through realistic presentation shown from human perspective views and work in the scale of human’s perceptible realm,
  whereas the we show and reason about the ecological and spatial functioning using 2D large-scale geospatial maps with enough abstraction to show global relationships.
  Even the software and tools behind working with these dimensions are considerably different. The way we measure and interpret this have different natures.
  We work with community, stakeholders and decision makers to understand individual’s feeling of the potential designs, whereas we work with concrete digits and maps to discuss how the water is regulated in the landscape,
  how much pollution we can remediate or how certain landform configuration can impact soil erosion, sedimentation and so on.

<h4> Motivation Tangible Geospatial modelling interfaces </h4>
<ul>
    <!-- <li>Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) can helps us experience and better understand data and processes through tangible interaction.</li> -->
    <li> Interaction through mouse, keyboard and display does not encourage creativity.</li>
    <li> Working with geospatial models and analysis is not intuitive and requires specialized software and training.</li>
    <li> Collaboration is restricted as typically only one user at a time can navigate and modify models. </li>

<aside class="notes">
So why are we interested in Tangible interfaces?
I am sure this photo shows a familiar setting -
we often get together around a screen to solve a design problem or use mouse or touch
to manipulate 3D data on 2D screen. Such manipulation of data often requires knowledge of a specific,
often complex software, usually only single person can access the data
creating barriers to collaboration and creativity.
So the real challenge is how to integrate geospatial anl

<h4>Tangible Landscape: real-time coupling with GIS</h4>

<p>With Tangible Landscape you can hold a GIS in your hands - feeling the shape of the earth, sculpting its topography, and directing the flow of water.</p>

<aside class="notes">
  We were able to take advatage of the fast and relatively accurate 3D scanning by Kinect
and developed the first system with real-time coupling of a 3D physical model, with GIS.
This video should give you a basic idea of the interaction - using a model of a real landscape,
we can modify the topography and get instant feedback on how our changes impact water flow and ponding.

<!-- --SLIDE-- 8: TL hardware SETUP -->
<section>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<img class="stretch" src="img/system_schema.png">
<p>Tangible Landscape couples a digital and a physical model through a continuous cycle of 3D scanning, geospatial modeling, and projection</p>
<aside class="notes">
    So how does the system work? In the previous slide you have seen the 3D model of a landscape.
This model is continuously scanned by the kinect, the scanned data are imported into GRASS GIS,
where a 3D digital elevation model is computed and a selected analysis or modeling is performed -
in our case contours are derived and water flow and ponding is simulated. A composite image
of the selected map layers is then projected over the model. In this way the system couples
the digital and physical models in a continuous cycle of scanning, modeling and projection,
providing the user continuous feedback.

<aside class="notes">
You have so far seen only sculpting sand with our hands, where we modify the continuous elevation surface. However some applications require different types of input data, such as objects. To make Tangible Landscape flexible in this regard, we developed multiple ways to interact with the physical models. Here we use a wooden marker to specify point locations on the landscape, for example view points or trailheads. Recently we have started to experiment with using laser pointer to draw objects, such as points, lines or polygons. Another option is to use colored sand to create polygons where the color represents certain attribute of the polygon and the height of the sand can represent intensity of that property. The most recent interaction we are testing now is creating areas using colored felt or paper of different shapes placed on the model.
These interactions can be combined to achieve intuitive interactions for particular application. Now I will show you some of the applications we developed for different study sites, using different geospatial models and each of them has different type of interaction.

    <aside class="notes">
        Topography is directly linked to visibility, so here we explore viewsheds at our campus. The physical model from sand represents digital surface model with canopy and we place the markers to specify viewpoints. Once the marker is detected, the viewshed is dynamically computed and visualized, here the visible areas are represented by yellow color.

<p>Simulation of urban growth scenarios with FUTURES model
    <aside class="notes">
        Here we switch from disease spread to urbanization application. We coupled TL with urban growth model called FUTURES implemented as a GRASS add-on and developed here at North Carolina State University. By placing colored sand we create red zones which attract new development or green zones for conservation. The height of the sand can represent the intensity - how much the zone attracts the development. Then we identify the polygons and rerun the urban growth model with these new conditions.
Now you can observe the animated growth of the city as predicted by the FUTURES based on the specified interventions.

<aside class="notes">
    Recently there has been a lot of excitement about serious games and how we can use them to engage public in science. We thought Tangible Landscape would be a great tool for serious gaming, so let’s look at a coastal flooding game. We prepared this game for a public event and people playing the game were trying to protect the homes on the coast when a foredune is breached during a storm surge. With limited sand budget they tried different ways of building barriers and they learned pretty quickly that a breach in one place can cause flooding of houses which are far away from the breach.

<!----SLIDE 14--Coupling-->
<section>
<h4> The coupling rationale </h4>
<ul>
<li> Real-time updating a georeferenced 3D model of the landscape based on user interaction with Tangible Landscape </li>
<li> Updating the attributes (shape, position) of 3D objects (e.g., plants) and surfaces (e.g., terrain) with their corresponding tangible objects  </li>
<li> Enabling user to control the viewpoints (camera position) and animation (e.g., walkthrough, flythrough) </li>
</ul>
    <aside class="notes">
    The coupling concept is based on adaptive 3d modelling framework. The idea was to generate a georeferenced 3D world of the under-study landscape, in which all the features and behavior of 3D elements like trees, buildings and surfaces are linked to their corresponding tangible object in tangible landscape. In this way, as users manipulate the tangible model and pieces, they can see, in real time, the changing landscape rendered on display or through virtual reality headsets like oculus.
    In addition to the automation adaptation aspect, we wanted to allow users to control the camera and animation so they can step into and navigate in their desired location in the landscape.

<h4>Physical setup</h4>

<img class="stretch" src="img/New_setup.png">

<h4> What is Blender? Why Blender? </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Free and open source 3d modelling and game engine software </li>
    <li>Easy scripting (Python) </li>
    <li>GIS and Virtual reality plugin</li>
    <li>High-quality real-time rendering and shading </li>

    <aside class="notes">
    Blender is a free and open source program for modeling, rendering, simulation, animation, and game design. The software has an internal python-based IDE and add-ons for importing GIS data to georeference the scene, and displaying the viewport in HMDs. It also allows realtime high-quality rendering and shading.

<!-- --SLIDE 17--Software Architecture -->
<section>
<h4> Software Architecture </h4>
<img class="stretch" src="img/Coupling_diagram.jpg">

    <aside class="notes">
    Briefly describing the workflow, GRASS GIS and Blender are loosely coupled through file-based communication. As user interacts with the tangible model or objects, GRASS GIS sends a copy of the geo-coordinated information or simulation to a specified system directory.
    We implemented a monitoring module in blender scripting environment that constantly watches the directory, identifies the type of incoming information, and apply relevant operations needed to update the 3d model. The input data can range from geospatial features like a raster or a point cloud, simple coordinates as a text file, or signals that prompt a command such as removing an object from the scene.

   While anytime during the interaction users can freely navigate in the environment using the mouse, they can also use a wooden marker or laser pointer to delineate their prefered vantage point.
   Lines created with laser pointer can be transferred as a line feature denoting user’s desired viewpoint and direction of view. Similarly, the center of the marker can represent the viewpoint and the colored tip as direction of view.
   The scene camera is then relocated to the line’s starting point and the direction of view is aligned to the line’s endpoint.
